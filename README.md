# Baby Tracker

This is a small website for tracking infants/babies.

Keep track of feedings, diaper changes, nap times, weight, breast milk pumping

## Installation
To install Baby Tracker for development,
first download [Pharo](https://www.pharo.org) 10 and then execute the following in a playground:
```smalltalk
Metacello new
	repository: 'github://ctSkennerton/baby_tracker/src';
	baseline: 'BabyTracker';
	load.
```

The development server will be running on port 8080.

## Deployment
Deployment is handled using Docker and Docker Compose.

```sh
cd deploy/docker
docker build -t babytracker:$(date -I) --no-cache .
## Modify docker-compose.yml to update the tag of the image to get the latest version
docker compose up
```

This will serve the web application on port 1403. You can use a reverse proxy like nginx to serve using https. See `deploy/nginx/setup.sh` for script and instructions generated by Digitalocean.
